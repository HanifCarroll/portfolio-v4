        Though I don't shy away from back-end development, I'm primarily
        captivated by front-end endeavors. I have great admiration for talented
        artists and designers. Therefore, my number one priority is to make
        beautiful, highly functional applications and websites, no matter the
        project content. ReactJS and NodeJS have been my primary tools of
        choice, but I gladly welcome the challenge of learning any new
        tech-stack.

        Being relatively early in my career, there are many areas and
        technologies relating to software development that I have interest in
        perusing. Obviously, this isn't something that can be done during work
        hours. For that reason, I'm a big believer in spending a good portion of
        my free time to master my "work-stack", so that I can spend some free
        time exploring those aforementioned uncharted territories.

        But programming isn't all that I'm interested in! I love lifting
        weights, playing ultimate frisbee, meeting people, talking about ideas,
        and being out in nature. Overall, I'm a genuinely positive guy that's
        looking to leave a lasting, positive impact on the world around him.
